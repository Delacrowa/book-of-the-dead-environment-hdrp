## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with distortion that was using previous frame instead of current frame
- Fixed an issue where disabled light where not upgrade correctly to the new physical light unit system introduce in 2.0.5-preview

## [2.0.5-preview]

### Added
- Add option supportDitheringCrossFade on HDRP Asset to allow to remove shader variant during player build if needed
- Add contact shadows for punctual lights (in additional shadow settings), only one light is allowed to cast contact shadows at the same time and so at each frame a dominant light is choosed among all light with contact shadows enabled.
- Add PCSS shadow filter support (from SRP Core)
- Exposed shadow budget parameters in HDRP asset
- Add an option to generate an emissive mesh for area lights (currently rectangle light only). The mesh fits the size, intensity and color of the light.
- Add an option to the HDRP asset to increase the resolution of volumetric lighting.
- Add additional ligth unit support for punctual light (Lumens, Candela) and area lights (Lumens, Luminance)
- Add dedicated Gizmo for the box Influence volume of HDReflectionProbe / PlanarReflectionProbe

### Changed
- Re-enable shadow mask mode in debug view
- SSS and Transmission code have been refactored to be able to share it between various material. Guidelines are in SubsurfaceScattering.hlsl
- Change code in area light with LTC for Lit shader. Magnitude is now take from FGD texture instead of a separate texture
- Improve camera relative rendering: We now apply camera translation on the model matrix, so before the TransformObjectToWorld(). Note: unity_WorldToObject and unity_ObjectToWorld must never be used directly.
- Rename positionWS to positionRWS (Camera relative world position) at a lot of places (mainly in interpolator and FragInputs). In case of custom shader user will be required to update their code.
- Rename positionWS, capturePositionWS, proxyPositionWS, influencePositionWS to positionRWS, capturePositionRWS, proxyPositionRWS, influencePositionRWS (Camera relative world position) in LightDefinition struct.
- Improve the quality of trilinear filtering of density volume textures.
- Improve UI for HDReflectionProbe / PlanarReflectionProbe

### Fixed
- Fixed a shader preprocessor issue when compiling DebugViewMaterialGBuffer.shader against Metal target
- Added a temporary workaround to Lit.hlsl to avoid broken lighting code with Metal/AMD
- Fixed issue when using more than one volume texture mask with density volumes.
- Fixed an error which prevented volumetric lighting from working if no density volumes with 3D textures were present.
- Fix contact shadows applied on transmission
- Fix issue with forward opaque lit shader variant being removed by the shader preprocessor
- Fixed compilation errors on Nintendo Switch (limited XRSetting support).
- Fixed apply range attenuation option on punctual light
- Fixed issue with color temperature not take correctly into account with static lighting
- Don't display fog when diffuse lighting, specular lighting, or lux meter debug mode are enabled.

## [2.0.4-preview]

### Fixed
- Fix issue when disabling rough refraction and building a player. Was causing a crash.

## [2.0.3-preview]

### Added
- Increased debug color picker limit up to 260k lux

## [2.0.2-preview]

### Added
- Add Light -> Planar Reflection Probe command
- Added a false color mode in rendering debug
- Add support for mesh decals
- Add flag to disable projector decals on transparent geometry to save performance and decal texture atlas space
- Add ability to use decal diffuse map as mask only
- Add visualize all shadow masks in lighting debug
- Add export of normal and roughness buffer for forwardOnly and when in supportOnlyForward mode for forward
- Provide a define in lit.hlsl (FORWARD_MATERIAL_READ_FROM_WRITTEN_NORMAL_BUFFER) when output buffer normal is used to read the normal and roughness instead of caclulating it (can save performance, but lower quality due to compression)
- Add color swatch to decal material

### Changed
- Change Render -> Planar Reflection creation to 3D Object -> Mirror
- Change "Enable Reflector" name on SpotLight to "Angle Affect Intensity"
- Change prototype of BSDFData ConvertSurfaceDataToBSDFData(SurfaceData surfaceData) to BSDFData ConvertSurfaceDataToBSDFData(uint2 positionSS, SurfaceData surfaceData)

### Fixed
- Fix issue with StackLit in deferred mode with deferredDirectionalShadow due to GBuffer not being cleared. Gbuffer is still not clear and issue was fix with the new Output of normal buffer.
- Fixed an issue where interpolation volumes were not updated correctly for reflection captures.
- Fixed an exception in Light Loop settings UI

### Added
- Configure the VolumetricLightingSystem code path to be on by default
- Trigger a build exception when trying to build an unsupported platform

- Add 3D texture support for DensityVolumes
- Add a better mapping of roughness to mipmap for planar reflection
- The VolumetricLightingSystem now uses RTHandles, which allows to save memory by sharing buffers between different cameras (history buffers are not shared), and reduce reallocation frequency by reallocating buffers only if the rendering resolution increases (and suballocating within existing buffers if the rendering resolution decreases)
- Add a Volumetric Dimmer slider to lights to control the intensity of the scattered volumetric lighting
- Add UV tiling and offset support for decals.
- Add mipmapping support for volume 3D mask textures

### Changed
- Default number of planar reflection change from 4 to 2

- Hide applyRangeAttenuation and FadeDistance for directional shadow as they are not used

### Removed
- Remove Resource folder of PreIntegratedFGD and add the resource to RenderPipeline Asset

### Fixed
- Fix ConvertPhysicalLightIntensityToLightIntensity() function used when creating light from script to match HDLightEditor behavior
- Fix numerical issues with the default value of mean free path of volumetric fog 
- Fix the bug preventing decals from coexisting with density volumes
