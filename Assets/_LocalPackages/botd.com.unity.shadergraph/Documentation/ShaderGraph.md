A Shader Graph enables you to build your shaders visually. Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network. You can do things like:

* Procedurally alter your surface appearance
* Warp and animate UVs
* Modify the look of your objects using familiar image adjustment operations
* Change your object’s surface based on useful information about it, its world location, normals, distance from camera, etc.
* Expose to the material inspector what you think is important to edit for your shader
* Share node networks between multiple graphs and users by creating subgraphs
* Create your own custom shader graph nodes through C# and HLSL

The graph framework gives instant feedback on the changes, and it’s simple enough that new users can become involved in shader creation.
